# Description
Use react to build an employee directory application from scratch. Use a random employee user api to populate the app. We must have a filter function to search, and create a way to sort by any property.

Goals for this project:

1. Build an application using react
2. Use the random user api to populate the app with "employees"
3. Sort the employees for name
4. Be able to search for an employee

# Usage
Use this link [Employee Directory App](https://employeedirectory12.herokuapp.com/)

When the website is loaded the screen will be populated with randomly generated "employees"

The user can hover over the "name" header and click. This will sort the employee names in ascending order.

Once the user presses name the list will sort.

If the user presses on name again it will sort again in descending order.

The user can also use the search bar to search for an employees name.

The user can then clear the results from the search bar by pressing the delete button. Once the search bar is clear the application will reload the employee directory. Or, the user can press the "Reset Page" buttong beside the search bar to reset the application.
